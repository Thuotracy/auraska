            <h2 style="color: white; margin-left: 12%;">How we use your information</h2>

                We may process your personal information in order to fulfil our contract with you and to provide you with our services. This includes the following purposes:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <p>We may process your personal data where necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In order to reconcile our legitimate interests with your rights, we have introduced appropriate control mechanisms. On this basis, we process your data for the following purposes:</p>
                <li><i class="fa fa-ravelry" aria-hidden="true"></i> Provide our services</li>
                <li><i class="fa fa-ravelry" aria-hidden="true"></i> Manage customers disputes</li>

            <h2 style="color: white; margin-left: 12%;">How we secure your information</h2>
            <p>
                We use appropriate security measures to protect the security of your personal information both online and offline. These measures vary based on the sensitivity of the personal information we collect, process and store and the current state of technology. We also take measures to ensure service providers that process personal data on our behalf also have appropriate security controls in place.
            </p><br>

            <p>
                We will only keep your information for as long as is reasonably required for the purposes for which it was submitted or otherwise as determined by law or regulation. Once we no longer need your information it will be securely and confidentially destroyed.
            </p><br>

            <h2 style="color: white; margin-left: 12%;">International data transfers</h2>
            <p>
                Some recipients of your personal information, such as third party sub-processors, are located outside of Kenya or have offices in countries where data protection laws may provide a different level of protection than the laws in Kenya. When transferring personal data to such recipients, we provide appropriate safeguards.
            </p><br>

            <h2 style="color: white; margin-left: 12%;">Automated decision making</h2>
            <p>
                We may use technologies that are considered automated decision making or profiling. We will not make any automated decisions about you that would significantly affect you unless such a decision is necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract with you, we have obtained your consent, or we are required by applicable law to use such technology. You will find information on your right to object to this processing of your data below under Your rights as a data subject.
            </p><br>

            <h2 style="color: white; margin-left: 12%;">Your rights</h2>
            <p>
                Under certain circumstances, you have rights under the Kenya Data Protection Act No 24 of 2019 and the EU General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) in relation to your personal data. To summarise, you have the right to:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><i class="fa fa-ravelry" aria-hidden="true"></i> Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</li>

                <li><i class="fa fa-ravelry" aria-hidden="true"></i> Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</li>

                <li><i class="fa fa-ravelry" aria-hidden="true"></i> Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</li>

                <li><i class="fa fa-ravelry" aria-hidden="true"></i> Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</li>

                <li><i class="fa fa-ravelry" aria-hidden="true"></i>Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:</li><br>

                    <ul style="margin-left: 2%;">
                        <li><i class="fa fa-circle-thin" aria-hidden="true"></i> If you want us to establish the data's accuracy;</li>
                        <li><i class="fa fa-circle-thin" aria-hidden="true"></i> Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it;</li>
                        <li><i class="fa fa-circle-thin" aria-hidden="true"></i> where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it;</li>
                    </ul>
                <li><i class="fa fa-ravelry" aria-hidden="true"></i> Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</li>

                <li><i class="fa fa-ravelry" aria-hidden="true"></i> Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent or on another lawful basis.</li>
            </ul>
